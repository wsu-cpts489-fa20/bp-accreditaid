Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.	Decomposes a real-world scenario or problem statement into set of subproblems that need to be addressed in order to solve the original problem.	Identifies constraints and requirements of a problem.	Formulates computing problems in such a way that they can be addressed through approaches and methods appropriate to the discipline.
"Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline."	Formulates one or more viable system designs to meet specified requirements.

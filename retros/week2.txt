For week two we focused on the admin side of our app. We added pages for admins to add/edit programs and courses and allow admins to assign courses to instructors. We also added a modal for admins to email instructors. As a group we aggreed that we started this too late into the week and should have held a checkin meeting in the middle of the week to make sure all team members were making good progress. This upcoming week we decided to have another meeting on Wednesday to check in with everyone. We will be working on the instructor side of acredit aid, adding a dashboard, and pages to support organizing and uploading course deliverables, materials, and readings.

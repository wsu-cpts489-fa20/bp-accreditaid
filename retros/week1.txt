For week one we did a lot of backend work. This included refactoring the server code to several different files and also experimenting with storing files in s3. We also restyled the website and created different user account types. For the next week we will be more efficient with how the work is split up by working in pairs. Our main issue last week was that we didn't closely follow the requirements for a milestone, so we didn't do any testing and didn't update the readme. For week 2 we will do more clientside work, focusing on the administrator user role to add programs and courses.

Week 3 was a very productive week for us all. We split into two teams instead of 3 teams this time. The team of 3 was able to further subdivide their work in a way that combined fairly nicely. The team of two worked together on their features as each other's code depended on the other's. Previosly we held 2 meetings a week, one on monday to assign out work, and one on thursday to merge everything together and prepare for the demo the next day. This week we also held a short check in meeting on Wednesday to make sure everyone was making good progress and assist someone if they were struggling with any part.
